# motorizedSchedule
little exercise to practice vanilla javascript

A company has a departure time for motorized vehicles from 8am to 8pm in 30-minute intervals
and each schedule has a quota of 8 motorized vehicles.

- When a user chooses a schedule, it must be green.
- When a user has selected a schedule, and clicks on it, it must be deselected.
- When the schedule already has 8 motorized vehicles assigned it must be shown in red.
